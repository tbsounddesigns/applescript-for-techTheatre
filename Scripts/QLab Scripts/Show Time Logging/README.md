Drop the "A" script cues into your QLab workspace at the corresponding sound cues that trigger at House Open (Preshow), Top of Act 1, Intermission, Top of Act 2, and end of the show. 

Then, use the "B" script cues to add calculated running times for Act 1, Intermission, Act 2, and total running time at the bottom of your log file after each of the "A" script cues have been triggered.
