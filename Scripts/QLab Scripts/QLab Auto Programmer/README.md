Fill out your sound cue sheet using the "Example Cue Sheet" provided in this folder as a template. Fill out things like the duration, target cue number, label, description, cue number, etc...

Once you fill this out, run the "QLab Auto Programmer" script, select the CSV file you just edited, and watch as your QLab workspace is automatically populates with all your cues, their names, the right fade times, and more!

This script is NOT meant to 100% build your workspace. There's always little things that you'll need to finalize and/or fix. If anything, you should ALWAYS look over your workspace to make sure that things are targeted correctly.

This script does NOT drop in media files that you target. You must apply these targets yourself.

*This script runs on QLab 5*
